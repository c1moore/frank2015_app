	*		limit (i.e. start_time<=timestamp<=(start_time+duration)).

	*		current_time-time_stamp)<=2).
	*	- The user has not voted yet, so changing one's mind is not permitted.
	*	- The `choice` is a valid alphabetical option for this vote.

	* @param email - Current user's email

	* @param submission_time - the time at which the vote was submitted
