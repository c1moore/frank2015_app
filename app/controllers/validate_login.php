<?php
	/**
	* This controller checks the credentials of a user trying to signin against the credentials in
	* our database.  If the credentials are accurate (they exist and the password matches), a status
	* of 200 is sent back to the frontend along with all information required by the frontend to set
	* the user in the localstorage; on the other hand, if the credentials are not accurate a 400 
	* error is sent back.  If any errors occur connecting with the database, an error of 500 is
	* returned.
	*
	* To determine if an email or username was sent, we will determine if $_POST['username'] contains
	* an '@', if it does we can safely assume it is an email, otherwise it was a username.  We use
	* strpos() to determine whether or not this field contains the '@'.  Event though this function
	* could return 0 if an '@' was the first character, this is not a valid email address and it will
	* be assumed that the string was a username.
	*
	* Since timing attacks may be a concern, instead of immediately returning once we have determined
	* the password is incorrect we will wait a random amount of time then return an error.
	*
	* @param username - the username submitted by the user
	* @param password - the plain text password submitted by the user
	*
	* @return user_id - if the credentials are accurate, the unique user_id is returned
	* @return email - if the creadentials are accurate, the email address used to signup is returned
