frank2015_app
=============

While this project was orginally going to be an iOS and Android mobile app, time constraints and resources limited us to a web app instead.  The deadline for this project is February 24, 2015 and began December 2014.  Testing at the moment is nonexistant, unfortunately and against my better judgement, due to several factors: the time limit, the number of people working on this project (me), and lack of resources on the server being used by frank to accomodate testing frameworks at the moment.

<h3>Contributions</h3>

Contributions are welcome.  I have not read through it, but the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#">AngularJS GIT conventions</a> might be a good resource if you have not done this before.  Make sure your code is formatted nicely, commented, and tested.
